                    <br />
                    <br />
                    My name is Syed Muhammad Aziz Ahmed, and I have been honing my skills in web development since 2018. Over the years, I have gained extensive experience in building dynamic, user-friendly web applications, specializing in full-stack development with React, Next.js, and Django. I am passionate about creating clean, efficient code and delivering high-quality solutions that meet both technical and business requirements. Additionally, I leverage Bootstrap for responsive, mobile-first design to ensure an optimal user experience across devices. My continuous drive to learn and adapt to new technologies allows me to stay at the forefront of web development trends and best practices.
